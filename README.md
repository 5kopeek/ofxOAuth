Description
-----------

An OAuth 1.0 system (via [liboauth](http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/)) with pin-less verification via a mini callback server (screenshot above).  Examples included for Twitter, Fitbit, etc.


The demo requires: 

openFrameworks https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks 

Use
-----------

1.  Register an app and get your CONSUMER_KEY / CONSUMER_SECRET from the API of your choice (e.g. Twitter).  Set the callback URL of your app to [http://127.0.0.1] and make sure it is set up as a "web based" app (even though it is a desktop based app).  This is so you can use the built-in web-server for pin-less authentication.

2.  Setup the oauth client with the correct authentication endpoints.  Easy Examples are included for Twitter and Fitbit.  In some cases, the easy setup must be overridden to account for non-standard endpoints (see th eFitbit example).

3.  During the first use, you will be redirected to the API's authentication server to allow your account to be used with the app you created.  If your callback information is setup correctly (it should be automatically generated by the built-in mini web server), you will be redirected back to a local webpage like [http://127.0.0.1:8080/?oauth_token=...]. The built in webserver will parse the information and pass it back to ofxOAuth.  ofxOAuth will then save the credentials to an xml file (the location and filename can be specified during setup).

4.  Make authenticated calls to your api.  Press spacebar in the examples to test.

5.  If you prefer to NOT use the built in authentication server, then you can disable it by calling `oauth.setEnableVerifierCallbackServer(false);`.  You are responsible for acquiring the pin from the user via a GUI element or other means.
